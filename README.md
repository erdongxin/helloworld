# Collaborative Escape Room with Private Clues

Experience an exhilarating multiplayer online escape room game where each player receives encrypted clues that can only be deciphered by them, all powered by **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**. Engage in a thrilling challenge that not only tests your intellect but also your ability to communicate effectively with your team to unravel the mysteries hidden within the game.

## Problem Statement

In traditional escape room games, clues are accessible to all players, which can lead to information overload and a lack of collaboration. Players often rely on individual prowess, which diminishes team dynamics and the essence of cooperative gameplay. Without a structured method for sharing information confidentially, teams may struggle to piece together the overall puzzle, ultimately reducing the fun and engagement levels.

## The FHE Solution

Leveraging **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**, this project revolutionizes the classic escape room experience. With FHE, each player's clues are encrypted in such a way that they can only access and solve their own parts without revealing the larger puzzle. This ensures that participants must communicate and collaborate to piece together the solution, fostering deeper connections and enhanced gameplay. Utilizing open-source libraries like **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, we have built an environment where each cryptographically protected clue adds to the immersive experience, while maintaining privacy and confidentiality.

## Key Features

- 🔒 **Encrypted Clues**: Each player receives unique, encrypted clues that can only be decrypted by them.
- 🤝 **Collaborative Gameplay**: Players must communicate effectively to piece together the overall puzzle using clues they cannot independently decode.
- 🧩 **Complex Puzzles**: Some puzzles require multiple encrypted clues combined in a homomorphic manner to be solved, enhancing the challenge.
- 👁️‍🗨️ **Immersive Experience**: A first-person perspective allows players to explore and interact with a 3D environment, deepening the immersion within the escape room.
- 🕵️‍♀️ **Mystery and Intrigue**: Themes of detective work and suspense elevate the gaming experience, keeping players engaged from start to finish.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption SDK**
- **Concrete**: For secure multi-party computation.
- **TFHE-rs**: For efficient and flexible homomorphic encryption operations.
- **Node.js**: For backend development.
- **Hardhat/Foundry**: For smart contract deployment and development.
- **Three.js**: For creating a dynamic 3D environment.

## Installation Guide

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine.** If not, download and install it from the Node.js official website.
2. **Install Hardhat or Foundry** according to your preference for smart contract development.
3. **Fetch the project dependencies**. Open your terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command will download all required libraries, including Zama’s FHE libraries.

## Build & Run Guide

To compile, test, and run the project, execute the following commands in your terminal:

1. **Compile the Smart Contracts:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run Tests:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
   ```

### Example Code Snippet

Here’s a brief example showing how to initialize a player and their encrypted clue within the game:

```javascript
const { FHE } = require('Zama-FHE-SDK');

async function createPlayer(playerId) {
    const player = new Player(playerId);
    const encryptedClue = await FHE.encrypt("This is your encrypted clue.");
    player.setClue(encryptedClue);
    return player;
}

async function main() {
    const player1 = await createPlayer("Player1");
    console.log(`Player 1's encrypted clue: ${player1.getClue()}`);
}

main();
```

With this code, each player's unique encrypted clue is generated and securely stored, illustrating how Zama's FHE technology plays a pivotal role in ensuring the confidentiality and security of the gaming experience.
